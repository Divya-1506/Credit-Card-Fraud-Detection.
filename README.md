# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset of 284,807 transactions, with only 492 cases of fraud (0.172%). Using PCA-transformed features, except for 'Time' and 'Amount,' the model's accuracy is evaluated using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) to address the imbalance effectively.
